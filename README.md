# solving-decapawn

James introduced me to a chess variant named decapawn and said it hasnt been solved, idk if he was right, but im going to make a program to solve it.

The program can solve the game when it is given a depth of 20, I had to run it in pypy and it still look a while as this code isnt fully optimized and is single threaded
(White can always win)
(No matter its first move)
